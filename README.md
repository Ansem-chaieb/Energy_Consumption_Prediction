## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the next value of the "active_power" column in a dataset of household energy consumption. The solution includes:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- A Streamlit dashboard for data visualization and model insights
- Containerized model deployment
- A Flask API for serving predictions
- Cloud infrastructure design suggestion
- Considerations for production-scale operationalization

## Cloud Infrastructure Schema

Our proposed cloud infrastructure leverages AWS services to create a scalable, maintainable, and secure solution.

For a detailed diagram and explanation of the infrastructure, please refer to the [pdf](docs/Household_energy_consumption.pdf) file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 
- tensorflow
- streamlit 
- Docker
- flask

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository:

`https://github.com/Ansem-chaieb/ve2max_assessment.git`

`cd energy-consumption-prediction`

2. Build and run the Docker container:

`docker build -t energy-consumption-prediction .`

`docker run -p 5000:5000 energy-consumption-prediction`


## API Usage

Access the Flask API :
- Via web browser or curl: `http://localhost:5000`
- Using Postman: Import the provided Postman collection :
{
    "datetime": "2024-01-05 23:59:00"
}
- Using Thunder Client VS Code extension: 
  1. Install the Thunder Client extension in VS Code
  2. Click on the Thunder Client icon in the sidebar
  3. Create a new request to `http://localhost:5000/predict`
  4. Set the method to POST and add the JSON body as shown :
  

Note: To run the Flask API, please ensure that you have the AWS credentials properly configured in the .env file. If you wish to execute the API, I will need to send you the necessary credentials beforehand.
